#Generally,the residuals should be normally distributed around zero (i.e. a bell curve distribution).

#We can make a histogram to visualize this using ggplot2.

##Of the three linear models built, the one built relating mpg to cyl fitted well regardless of the negative correlation value got unlike VS and DRAT that have a positive correlation with mpg. This goes ahead to validate the phrase "Correlation isn't Causation".
##Through the Analysis of Variance we can see that the model is sound. The F-value of the High Performance Linear regression is 79.56 with a p-value of 6.113e-10. A high F-value indicates a strong relationship between the variables

#Looking at our one way ANOVA pdf we obtain the same Analysis of Variance, proving our model is sound with a F-value of 79.56 and P of 6.113e-10. 
#Our plots of the distribution of mpg show the more the number of cylinders, the lesser the value of mpg(i.e lesser the miles your car can travel)
#Therefore, in this model I would drop the 8 cylinder data due to low value of mpg. If you are looking to save money on gas, this model shows that a 4 cylinder engine is the way to go based on the mtcars data.
